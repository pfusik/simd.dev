# - build_db.py / extract_llvm_descs.py use PEP 585 generics at runtime
#   without `from __future__ import annotations`.
# - The build scripts call `Path.write_text(..., newline="\n")` to keep
#   committed JSON / JSONL line-ending-stable across Windows; the
#   `newline` kwarg on `write_text` was added in 3.10.
# Try `python3` first (Unix convention), then `python` (Windows / some
# minimal envs).
